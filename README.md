PAYDAY 2 modding
================

Goals:

* Press to respond to pager, rather than hold??

Current features:

* Autoreload. If your current magazine is empty, and you have bullets in
  reserve, you will start reloading - no waiting for another click of the
  trigger. This can be interrupted as usual and will resume afterwards.
* When you use your last body bag, you will be notified to grab more.
* Inspect your weapon to be shown your current orientation.
  Note that, sadly, this does not always correspond to the compass
  directions given in preplanning. Compass mark zero (described as north
  by the Inspect message) often points north, but not always. Examples:
  - The Diamond: East
  - Framing Frame day 3 is unclear. "East Main Room" and "West Main Room"
    backwards. But otherwise North.
  - Golden Grin Casino: North
  - Shadow Raid: North
  - Big Bank: East
  - Hotline Miama day 1: North
  - Border Crossing - VERY confusing.
    - The US is on the left and Mexico on the right. So most likely north is left (up is east).
    - Dead drop doctor bag, "north side alley", top of map, "south side alley", bottom of map.
    - Camera access, north top.
    - Blueprints, Mexico side - warehouse north is top, warehouse south is bottom
    - But USA side, "north hallway" is bottom of map! South-east hallway is top right! WUT.
    - 0 is up on the blueprints (both USA and Mexico sides).
  - Conclusion: Preplanning is sometimes just plain wrong.
