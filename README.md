PAYDAY 2 modding
================

Goals:

* Auto-reload.
  - If you switch to a weapon with no bullets in the mag, start reloading
  - If you empty the weapon, start reloading (sometimes happens automatically already)
  - If you stop sprinting and mag is empty, start reloading
  - And only if you have some reserve ammo.
