PAYDAY 2 modding
================

Goals:

* Press to respond to pager, rather than hold??

Current features:

* Autoreload. If your current magazine is empty, and you have bullets in
  reserve, you will start reloading - no waiting for another click of the
  trigger. This can be interrupted as usual and will resume afterwards.
* When you use your last body bag, you will be notified to grab more.
* Press Reload and Interact simultaneously to be shown your current
  orientation. Note that, sadly, this does not always correspond to the
  compass directions given in preplanning (eg in The Diamond, the "north"
  hall is in map east).
